# Developing
Development on leapp-daemon can be done on Mac, Windows, or Linux as long as you have Go installed. See the [go.mod](https://github.com/Noovolari/leapp-daemon/blob/master/go.mod) file located in the project root for the correct Go version.

## Quickstart
- Clone the repository with ```git clone https://github.com/Noovolari/leapp-daemon```
- Change directory into the project root
- Install dependencies with ```go get ./...```

## Basic functionality
Leapp-daemon is a set of REST APIs wrapped around an http client exposed on port 8080.

### Entry-point
The entry point is [main.go](https://github.com/Noovolari/leapp-daemon/blob/master/main.go) file located in the project root; the main elements are:
- The [configuration](https://github.com/Noovolari/leapp-daemon/blob/616470d9e8d668dd067eb63cac2024a2b463f67a/core/configuration/configuration.go) represent the current state of the software
- The [http-engine](https://github.com/Noovolari/leapp-daemon/blob/616470d9e8d668dd067eb63cac2024a2b463f67a/api/engine/engine.go) to respond to API calls
- The websocket for enabling full-duplex communication against multiple consumers
- The [timer](https://github.com/Noovolari/leapp-daemon/blob/616470d9e8d668dd067eb63cac2024a2b463f67a/core/timer/timer.go) to auto-rotate credentials

## Project Structure
The project main areas are:
- **api**: interfaces for interacting with core logic
- **core**: business logic
- **service**: middleware that serves as communication between api and core

## Testing
To test business logic you can use any API client like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
